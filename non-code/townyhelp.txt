Below are commands for towns. In towns, you can own plots and build structures on them. Building structures increases the money and XP you get from doing jobs! You can also own towns, and gain a bonus for all structures in your town, even if you don't own them!

**Note: `YX` means the Y coordinate and X coordinate of the plot. For example, a plot on the `G` row and the `4` column would be `G4`.**
