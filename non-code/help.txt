Welcome to TownyBot! TownyBot is a town-based RPG Discord bot. Starting with nothing but the will to thrive, work your way up from a lowly resident to the mayor of a metropolis!

The first thing you'll need to achieve that metropolis is some money. There are Four main jobs: Mining, Woodcutting, Farming, and Fishing. You can perform these jobs every 10 seconds with `-mine`, `-chop`, `-harvest`, and `-catch`. 

Once you've got money, you'll still need some land to work with. Ask any mayors in your server if you can join their town! They'll need to have a house for sale for you to join. You will also want some extra land to build structures. **Structures increase how much money and xp you make from jobs**, but be careful! The price for making structures increases exponentially. More info on how to use towns can be found in `-help towns`

Eventually, you'll want to make your own town. Though structure prices increase exponentially, **Mayors get a 10% bonus for ALL structures in their town, regardless of who owns them!**. Once you make a town, you'll want to keep some land for yourself. However, for all the land you can't afford to use yet can be given to residents! The more structures your residents make, the more money you make! You will still earn more money from structures you make yourself.

You're spending money to make money! Work through the ranks to become the richest TownyBot player! You can see the richest people via `-baltop`.
