# TownyBot
TownyBot is a town-based RPG Discord bot. Starting with nothing but the will to thrive, work your way up from a lowly resident to the mayor of a metropolis!

## Jobs
In TownyBot, players do jobs to earn money. This money can be used to buy land in other players' towns, structures on their land, or even creating their own town! These jobs include mining, woodcutting, fishing, and farming. Every time a player does a job, they earn money and XP. Once they have enough XP, they can level up in their job and make even more money. 


## Towns
Towns are a major element in TownyBot, hence it being in the name. In towns, players can use land to create structures. Structures such as mines, forests, ponds, and farms help increase the effectiveness of mining, woodcutting, fishing, and farming respectively. The more structures of a job type the player owns, the more money and XP they will make. Players can also make their own towns if they have enough money, and can invite people to their towns. Mayors earn a bonus based on the structures their residents make, so growing their town by helping the residents also benefits the mayor.
